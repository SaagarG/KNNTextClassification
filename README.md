# KNNTextClassification
KNN algorithm is used to classify by finding the K nearest matches in training data and then using the label of closest matches to predict. Traditionally, distance such as euclidean is used to find the closest match.
The major problem in classifying texts is that they are mixture of characters and words. We need numerical representation of those words to feed them into our K-NN algorithm to compute distances and make predictions.
